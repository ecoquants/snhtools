The timing of any works, including construction or clearance work, should avoid disturbance to breeding birds, particularly ground nesting birds. Breeding birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) which prevents destruction or disturbance of any breeding birds and their nests. More information can be found on the SNH website at: https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-species/protected-species-z-guide/protected-species-birds
If the planning authority intends to grant planning permission against this advice then you must notify Scottish Ministers.
