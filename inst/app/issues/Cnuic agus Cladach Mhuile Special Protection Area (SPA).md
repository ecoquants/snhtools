The proposal lies partially within the Cnuic agus Cladach Mhuile SPA classified for its internationally important population of breeding golden eagles (_Aquila chrysaetos_). The site’s status means that the requirements of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 1994 as amended (the “Habitats Regulations”) or, for reserved matters the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 as amended apply. Consequently, Argyll and Bute Council is required to consider the effect of the proposal on the SPA before it can be consented (commonly known as Habitats Regulations Appraisal). The SNH website has a summary of the legislative requirements: https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/international-designations/natura-sites/protection-natura-sites.

In our view, this proposal is likely to have a significant effect on the golden eagle (_Aquila chrysaetos_) qualifying interest of the SPA. Consequently, Argyll and Bute Council is required to carry out an appropriate assessment in view of the site’s conservation objectives for its qualifying interest. If the proposal is undertaken strictly in accordance with the following advice, it will no longer be likely to have a significant effect and an appropriate assessment will not be required.

We advise the following:

- Where construction is planned between the 1st of February and the 1st of August, the applicant must liaise with SNH with regards to golden eagle nest activity. In the absence of up to date information, the applicant will be required to undertake survey work of all suitable nesting habitat within 1 mile of the development footprint; consultation with RSPB Mull Officer is recommended. No construction work is permitted within 1 mile of an active golden eagle nest without written agreement of Argyll and Bute Council and SNH.
